GOTO _endnotes_

My old 4DOS solution for easily uncompressing various archives using the right application and switches. 


2018-04-13
  --  This is at least as old as 2007-07-22, and I know it's *much* older.
  --  I have not come across an earlier version of this script.  Perhaps one day.
  --  There seem to be some non-traditional characters in here.  I hope my various editors haven't mangled things.

GOTO _endnotes_
uncompress (make it in modules! - separate files in a BATCHES\UNC\ control dir as with arj.dat which has the ARJ commands within..  It would make it very easy to maintain.. perhaps combine all the data files into one data file??

unc should ask if it needs to create a new dir.. also, if the preexistant dir is empty, it should use it anyways. 

fix the unc free space detection / drive scanning.. don't scan past lastdrive 

point towards the true exes after testing and shuffling the exes

if i have a file "1" and i extract it as a .zip, unc will not work.. it looks
for 1.zip  also, recovering from the error kills that original file

i have no clue why, but rar will not move to the proper dir!!

make the directory have the same description as the filename, with some
marking to have me notice it.. (just in case)


			*** NOTES ***

 because I finished the background code on the renumbering process.. it is
possible to have the directory name not be unique but have a number at the end!
wooh!
 A.I. Change the unique directory thing.  Have it prompt the user, [enter] to
make a unique dir, have it check if the prompted dir exists or not.



taken from a noteware note:
- make sure a drive is active AND ready!  it dies on Z:
- doesn't show the default dir with [enter]
spawn "<name>" from:         -- should be TO, not from



When out of space on CWD, don't have it re-search to check if that drive has
free space again, in that list.. and don't have it pull up CD-ROMs.  (This may
already be the case!)

 -- after having entered in a directory to spawn the dir from, say the full
path which will be used to uncompress to.  and remember that the SCREEN
statements will have the archiver text start nearer to the top and this will
overwrite some of the text from the search thing.

add an ON BREAK statement?  Detect a break after archiver execution?
technically the detection of the errorlevel can understand if there's been a
break.

research the archiver errorlevels

This will be referred to as "this" throughout this' text.  I don't wish to name
this as a program, a piece of software, a text, a betch file or anything else.

I take no responsibility for its use .. morality, blabla

Persons not fitting into the categories listed above may use this only if they
agree to eloquently report any problems in a reasonable amount of time.

This program requires the external archivers to function.
If you want other programs / options supported, then suggest and / or supply
them.

Should I have an info display afterwards?  It would slow things down.

Program version, date/time/size(/CRC?)

A ` or % (not ^ though) as an input REALLLLY screws things up.  How should I go
about removing them? (It's kinda like the old trick to hack into BBS' written
in BASIC eh?).  Here is one method, but it's messy to *see* those errors if
they show up:
IF %@INDEX[`,`,]=-1 ECHO SETDOS/X-7 is active
IF ERRORLEVEL 0 ECHO SETDOS/X+7 is active
(A nice twist on the old:  IF NOT "%@EVAL[1+1]"=="2" ECHO This is DOS!  Ugh!

I have no REAL way to predict how much space files will take after being
expanded.
	Problems:
	compressed drives
	cluster sizes
As such, I just use 5x the archive size as the expected filesize.
I could provide source code for at least a couple of the programs in order to
let somebody build us a custom program to see what a file will be expanded to,
but even in this case it would be a serious slowdown to have to check files in
this manner before uncompressing them.

Spif up the help.  Don't make it just the one screen, have it be several that
the user can pick between.  Show command examples and give a GOOD description!

be able to specify a path to unarchive to (%1 or something).  prompt if it's
there already
check if the first character is a \ or the second character is a :
Add: Detect the use of a "\" in %1, and if so, then decompress to that dir

make a function (%1) to have the file uncompressed in the directory in which it
resides, and not the current directory.

: add in *.r01
if the archive is .r01 -> RAR extract *.r02...*.r??
if the archive is .a01 -> RAR extract *.a02...*.r??
check for the existance of .r01 and .a01 if the archive is .rar/.arj
not necessary for rar, but for arj it is.

for *.### -> have it autodetect the filename type (edit prep to leave
 that info out? -> have it notify if the *.### is incorrect. (file missing)
New feature:  If the filename has a special extension (.###), then read the
file to get the path information and filename of the file that should be
uncompressed in its place.
-- if i have it read the description instead, i coukd save space...


  Questions:
  ~~~~~~~~~~
 * What other SET statements need to be saved beyond the SETLOCAL boundery?!
 * I think my use of >NUL and /Q etc.. need to be checked..
 * What decompresses *.lha ?
 * which version of 4dos does this require?

  Future projects:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Be able to handle having not been given an extension?
- Add in a log?
- Add in more switches, to delete a file afterwards.  Be careful, research a
while back put me off making more switches.  Something about not knowing how
to pass them to the archivers?  It should be easily solved though.
- Redo the colour commands so that they do not require ANSI.  I don't believe
there is a proper way for me to �[K with the available technology.
- Do wildcards with the FOR / DO function! have *. and .* and other ?!
- Check for self extracting capability with unp (4.11 is latest)
- Check for the "types" on the uncompressed files, and if description is
nonexistant, (use filed39a), and describe each file.  Otherwise, append to
the description or otherwise alter it?
- Include a conversion ability, or otherwise extract the code from this one
to make an external conversion program.
- *OH* the things I could do with errorlevels and conversion and all the
related things.. with detection of damaged archives and autorepair
subroutines and..... .....

- Include adaptations to use external programs to convert cross platform
file types and archives, and then extract from them.
  - lbr64.exe   -> dissolves commodore (64?) .lbr files
  - ax.exe      -> dissolves commodore 64/128 .arc files
  + Do I want to have the conversion for tokenized 64 basic/cbmscii ?
- Include other, rarely used programs??  What else is there?
- Include realtime executable decompression (unp 4.11) ?

Function Lowdown:
(Am I using that word right?!)

 * This is a quick list of the major functions of this program.

Uncompresses a specified archive to a directory of its own.

- Can create a unique directory when needed.
- Easily modified to work with ANY commandline archiver
- Special error trapping for .arj and .uc2
- Basic error trapping for (most?) other archivers
- Advanced CD-ROM and free space A.I.:  Where necessary, it will prompt the
	user to uncompress to one of the listed useable drives.


Version History:

 * After a thinking hard about it, I have decided to keep a bit of a history
list for those of you who are keeping track of the changes from time to time.
Technically, this entire concept is useless except to those who wish to know
what the changes are before playing with a new version.  I also feel that it
is nice for those of you who are helping me out, in order to let you know the
problems I have "conquered" and the additions I have made.
 * a.b.c is the standard (I think) version numbering system.  a is a *major*
change, b is a large change and c is a minor fix.  This numbers are meant to
show the difference between a old version and the latest version.  If you are
using and like v1.3.0, and 1.4.9 is current, you can expect a great deal of
improvement between the versions and ought to update yourself.
 * The list will have a marker on the left-hand side, - is a minor change, +
is a large change and * is a humungous change (I don't expact to have ANY of
these.  Something constituting a change like that would be to the degree of
porting it to UNIX, which, yes, would be silly.


* 2007-07-22
** I shuffled this changelog around to put the newer items at the top.
** Ok, I asked for it.  "Rewritten in UNIX"  =)

2.1.0	Rewrite planned.. ugh.
+	Added compatability with the 4dos UNIX-like slashes option, by putting
	a space between the archive executable and it's first switch.
Feb 01	Hmm, was I even keeping track of any changes in the last couple of
	years?  This batch is broken.. I have to redo a lot of it from scratch
	to get it to do anything at all.. sigh.
Aug 99	Heh, it seems I haven't been keeping revision updates up to date.  =)
	Actually I totally forgot that this existed.
-	Pkware v2.50 is finally installed on my system.
-	Long filename awareness finally added and 100% functional.

2.0.0
 (to)	Version numbers between here and 1.4.9 have been ignored.  The version
Aug 98	number has been incremented to 2.0.0 to reflect the extreme difference
	between this and the previous release (1.3.0 I believe).
*	Major updates (see 1.4.9 change history)
*	Finished the routine which deals with there not being enough free space
	or the file to be uncompressed being on a CD-ROM.  I will spiff it up
	some more at a future date when I'm colourizing.
	Jan 01 1998	Eric Franklin <>
			Insistance of high-level A.I. forced me to rethink the
			entire routine and add in the drive search function and
			user input.
-	Some more tweaking of the function to unarchive when without free
	space on the default drive.
-	Added the Auto-Unarchive (CD to %A when without free space) function
	and gave it A.I. to detect if that directory exists or not.
-	Added the "custom setup" SET statements.

1.4.9
	Technically I should have released this program at least two times
	before now.  Every ?.x.? increment should be released.
-	Free space detection added.  It's rusty and needs to be seriously
	revamped.  For some reason it doesn't feel like working, so I've had
	to strip out it's intelligence to get it to work at all.  This section
	will be updated to detect a Cd-Rom by the %@CDROM flag and not in a
	round-about way with %@DISKFREE.
+	Added in support for a whole LOT of other archivers
-	Added in support for a archive redirection (*.###).  This support would
	mean that files can be in "multiple locations" at once (without
	resorting to editing the FAT).  So if an archive is categorizable in
	two distinct ways, the file can be essentially "copied" and can be
	drawn from using UNC in any of its locations.
-	Altered the archiver detection scheme
-	Added the filetype autodetection failure section.
-	Added the version history
-	Added the cheezy help listing
-	Added the SETLOCAL / ENDLOCAL bounderies to avoid problems on foreign
	computers such as running out of environment space or unintentionally
	executing an alias.  Unfortunately this assumes that C:\unc.tmp can be
	created and used.  I would have loved to avoid this, but it seems
	impossible.  I do not want to start a secondary shell or anything that
	complex and memory wasting, so this method will have to do.

1.x-1.2
95-96	Somewhere in here I had gotten help from many programmers after posting
	this program in the Fido 4DOS Batch Programmers Area.  Special thanks
	go towards Milo Van Der Leij and Phi Nguyen for their ideas.  There
	were also many other people who gave me inspiration to continue the
	project.

TEXT
Uncompresses an archive into a directory made from the archive name, CD-ing the
user there afterwards.

<> = required
[] = optional

unc[.btm] <archive_name.ext> [unarchive_filespec]

<archive_name.ext>	Archive Name (+ Extension)
[unarchive_filespec]	A switch passed to the unarchiver to indicate which
			files you wish to extract.


** EXAMPLE:  (While at C:\ and the archive is at C:\)

unc archive.rar *.nfo

{1} This will create C:\ARCHIVE {2} and uncompress *.nfo from C:\archive.rar
into that directory.  The user will then be left in C:\ARCHIVE

** EXAMPLE:  (While at C:\ and the archive is at D:\)

unc.btm D:\archive.rar

{1} This will create C:\ARCHIVE {2} and uncompress the archive from
D:\archive.rar into that directory.  The user will be left in C:\ARCHIVE

** EXAMPLE: (While at Z:\ and the archive is at Z:\ -- Z: is a CD-ROM drive)

unc archive.rar

The CD-ROM is detected, and unless the user has set the quick-switch to auto-
uncompress, UNC will scan the other drives for available free space.  The user
will be prompted to pick the drive to use and the directory to create the
directory ARCHIVE {2}.

1 - Assuming there is enough calculated free space on the current drive
2 - Or a random directory if the file or directory C:\ARCHIVE already exists
