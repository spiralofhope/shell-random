To keep Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) running in the background without an open terminal window, you need to prevent WSL2 from shutting down its lightweight virtual machine (VM) when no shell is active. By default, WSL2 terminates all running distributions and the underlying VM when the last shell closes to conserve resources. However, you can work around this to keep WSL2 active for faster shell startup, especially useful for your Debian setup, without leaving a visible window open. Below are the primary methods to achieve this, along with considerations for your use case.

### Why WSL2 Takes Time to Start
WSL2 uses a lightweight VM to run a full Linux kernel, which requires initialization (e.g., starting the VM, networking, and file system integration) when you launch a shell. Keeping the VM running in the background eliminates this startup delay, which can range from a few seconds to over 20 seconds depending on your system and configuration.

### Method 1: Run a Long-Running Background Process in WSL2
You can start a long-running process within your Debian distribution to keep the WSL2 VM active without an open terminal window. A common approach is to use a lightweight process like `sleep` or a daemon like `dbus-daemon`.

#### Steps
1. **Open a WSL2 Debian Shell**:
   - Launch your Debian distribution via `wsl -d Debian` from PowerShell or Command Prompt.
2. **Start a Background Process**:
   - Run a command like:
     ```bash
     nohup sleep 365d &
     ```
     - `nohup` ensures the process continues running even after the shell closes.
     - `sleep 365d` runs for a year, keeping the VM alive.
     - The `&` sends the process to the background.
     - Output is redirected to `nohup.out` in your home directory.
   - Alternatively, use a daemon like `dbus-daemon`:
     ```bash
     if ! ps x -u $(whoami) | grep [d]bus-daemon > /dev/null; then
         nohup dbus-launch true &
     fi
     ```
     - This checks if `dbus-daemon` is already running and starts it if not, keeping the VM active.[](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1435938/is-it-possible-to-run-a-wsl-app-in-the-background)
3. **Close the Terminal**:
   - Exit the shell with `exit`. The WSL2 VM will remain running due to the background process.
4. **Verify WSL2 is Running**:
   - Run `wsl --list --all` in PowerShell to confirm Debian is in the "Running" state.
5. **Launch New Shells**:
   - Open new Debian shells with `wsl -d Debian`. They should start almost instantly since the VM is already active.

#### Automation
To ensure the process starts automatically:
- Add the command to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` in Debian:
  ```bash
  if ! ps x -u $(whoami) | grep [d]bus-daemon > /dev/null; then
      nohup dbus-launch true &
  fi
  ```
- This runs the background process every time a new shell starts, ensuring the VM stays active even after a system reboot or WSL2 restart.

#### Pros
- Simple to implement within Linux.
- No additional Windows scripting required.
- Lightweight resource usage (e.g., `sleep` or `dbus-daemon` uses minimal CPU/memory).

#### Cons
- If the process is killed (e.g., via `wsl --terminate Debian` or `wsl --shutdown`), you’ll need to restart it manually or via automation.
- Requires manual setup in each distribution if you use multiple WSL2 instances.

### Method 2: Use a VBScript to Launch WSL2 Invisibly
You can use a VBScript to start WSL2 in a hidden window, keeping the VM running without a visible terminal. This approach leverages Windows’ scripting capabilities to launch a WSL process silently.

#### Steps
1. **Create a VBScript**:
   - Create a file named `start_wsl_hidden.vbs` in a location like `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\wsl_scripts\`.
   - Add the following content:
     ```vbscript
     Set ws = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
     ws.Run "wsl -d Debian", 0
     ```
     - Replace `Debian` with your distribution name (check with `wsl --list`).
     - The `0` parameter hides the window.[](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1435938/is-it-possible-to-run-a-wsl-app-in-the-background)
2. **Run the Script on Startup**:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `shell:startup`, and press Enter to open the Windows Startup folder.
   - Copy or move `start_wsl_hidden.vbs` to this folder (`C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`).
   - Alternatively, create a shortcut to the script and place the shortcut in the Startup folder.
3. **Test the Script**:
   - Double-click the script to run it. It should start WSL2 and your Debian distribution without opening a visible window.
   - Verify with `wsl --list --all` in PowerShell to see Debian as "Running".
4. **Launch Shells**:
   - Open new Debian shells with `wsl -d Debian`. They should start quickly since the VM is running.

#### Optional: Add a Service or Daemon
- Inside Debian, configure a service (e.g., `sshd` or `cron`) to run automatically:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable ssh
  sudo systemctl start ssh
  ```
- This ensures a process keeps the distribution active. Use `systemctl` if your Debian setup supports `systemd` (may require enabling `systemd` in WSL2; see Method 3).

#### Pros
- Completely hidden from view, avoiding desktop clutter.
- Runs automatically on Windows startup.
- Works across WSL2 distributions if modified to include them.

#### Cons
- Requires Windows scripting knowledge.
- If WSL2 is shut down (e.g., `wsl --shutdown`), the script must be re-run.
- May not persist certain services unless combined with a Linux-side daemon.

### Method 3: Enable `systemd` for Persistent Services
WSL2 now supports `systemd` (as of recent updates in 2023 and later), which allows you to run background services like a native Linux system. This is ideal for keeping processes like `sshd` or `cron` running, ensuring the WSL2 VM stays active.

#### Steps
1. **Enable `systemd` in Debian**:
   - Open a Debian shell: `wsl -d Debian`.
   - Edit `/etc/wsl.conf` (create it if it doesn’t exist):
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/wsl.conf
     ```
   - Add:
     ```ini
     [boot]
     systemd=true
     ```
   - Save and exit.
2. **Restart WSL2**:
   - Run `wsl --shutdown` in PowerShell to stop all WSL2 instances.
   - Restart Debian with `wsl -d Debian`.
3. **Configure a Service**:
   - Install and enable a lightweight service, e.g., `ssh`:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install openssh-server
     sudo systemctl enable ssh
     sudo systemctl start ssh
     ```
   - This keeps the VM running as long as the service is active.
4. **Automate Startup**:
   - Combine with the VBScript from Method 2 to start Debian silently on Windows boot.
5. **Verify**:
   - Check `systemd` is running: `systemctl status`.
   - Confirm Debian is running: `wsl --list --all`.
   - Open new shells with `wsl -d Debian` for instant access.

#### Pros
- Mimics native Linux behavior with `systemd`.
- Services like `sshd` can be managed systematically.
- Persistent across shell sessions.

#### Cons
- Requires `systemd` support (available in recent WSL2 versions).
- Slightly more complex setup.
- Services may consume more resources than a simple `sleep` process.

### Method 4: Use a Batch Script for Occasional Use
For occasional use, create a batch script to restart WSL2 silently when needed.

#### Steps
1. **Create a Batch File**:
   - Create `wsl_restart.bat` in a convenient location:
     ```batch
     @echo off
     wsl --shutdown
     mshta vbscript:createobject("wscript.shell").run("wsl.exe -d Debian",0)(window.close)
     ```
     - Replace `Debian` with your distribution name.[](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1435938/is-it-possible-to-run-a-wsl-app-in-the-background)
2. **Run When Needed**:
   - Double-click the script to shut down and restart WSL2 silently.
   - New shells will open quickly afterward.
3. **Optional Automation**:
   - Place in the Windows Startup folder or schedule via Task Scheduler for automatic execution.

#### Pros
- Simple for occasional use.
- No persistent processes if not needed.

#### Cons
- Requires manual execution unless automated.
- Less seamless than other methods.

### Additional Considerations
- **Resource Usage**: Keeping WSL2 running consumes memory (typically 1-2 GB for the VM, depending on configuration). Adjust limits in `~/.wslconfig`:
  ```ini
  [wsl2]
  memory=2GB
  swap=4GB
  ```
  - Restart WSL2 with `wsl --shutdown` after editing.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/basic-commands)
- **System Reboots**: All methods require restarting the process or script after a Windows reboot or `wsl --shutdown`.
- **Multiple Distributions**: If you use multiple WSL2 distributions, specify the target (e.g., `Debian`) in scripts or commands.
- **Performance**: WSL2 startup is slower than WSL1 due to the VM, but keeping it running eliminates this delay. WSL1 might be an alternative for faster startup but lacks full Linux kernel support.[](https://www.sitepoint.com/wsl2/)
- **Community Feedback**: Users on X have expressed frustration with WSL2 shutting down when shells close, especially for remote access scenarios like SSH. The above methods address this by keeping the VM alive.

### Recommended Approach
- **Primary**: Use **Method 3 (systemd)** for a robust, Linux-like solution, combined with **Method 2 (VBScript)** to start Debian silently on Windows boot. This ensures persistent services and no visible windows.
- **Quick Fix**: Use **Method 1 (background process)** with `nohup sleep` or `dbus-daemon` for a simple, low-effort solution.
- **Occasional Use**: Use **Method 4 (batch script)** if you only need to keep WSL2 running sporadically.

### Testing and Verification
- After implementing any method, test by closing all Debian terminals and running `wsl --list --all`. Debian should remain "Running".
- Open a new shell with `wsl -d Debian` and confirm it starts instantly (typically under a second).
- If issues arise, check logs in `/var/log` (for `systemd` services) or `nohup.out` (for background processes).

### Troubleshooting
- **VM Stops**: If `wsl --list --all` shows Debian as "Stopped", ensure your background process or service is running (`ps aux` in Debian).
- **Permission Issues**: Run scripts or PowerShell commands as Administrator if WSL2 fails to start.
- **Systemd Not Working**: Ensure your WSL2 version supports `systemd` (update WSL with `wsl --update`).[](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1435938/is-it-possible-to-run-a-wsl-app-in-the-background)
- **High Resource Usage**: Monitor Task Manager for WSL processes (`Vmmem`) and adjust `~/.wslconfig` if needed.
